    This takes into account the GW wavelength and is only important
    when this is comparable to the detector arm length.

    From R. Schilling, CQG 14 (1997) 1513-1519, equation 5,
    with n = 1, nu = 0.05, ignoring overall phase and cos(nu)^2.
    A small value of nu is used instead of zero to avoid infinities.

    Returns the square of the dh/dL function, and the same divided by
    the arm length squared.
