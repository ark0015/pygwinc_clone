# Contributions to pygwinc

The pygwinc project welcomes your contributions.  Our policy is that
all contributions should be peer-reviewed.  To facilitate the review,
please do not commit your work to this repository yourself.  Instead,
fork the repository and send a merge request.

If your change affects the shape of a noise curve, your commit message
should make note of that, and provide a justification.  It will also
be necessary to update the reference curves stored in DCC entry
[T18xxxxx](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T18xxxxx), after the change is
applied.
